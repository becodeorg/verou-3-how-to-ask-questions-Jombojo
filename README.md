Main:
Use a precise and with precise information title
What is the problem
What have I done to try to solve it(Look around on the web before asking a question)
What does not work
What is the goal of the program
Explain the end goal of this piece of code
Show the part of the code that does not work

Example questions:

Random number q
title: Trying to get a REAL random number
q: I've been using Math.floor(Math.random) but noticed it is not really random. I need a real random number for a security password.
I've noticed this is not a natural random number. Is there another method that will help me get a true random number?
